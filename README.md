### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I'm working on computational methods for materials and beyond.
- ðŸŒ± I'm actively learning CS and high-performance computing (Programming Paradigms, Parallel Computing, ...).
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've always been a hardware enthusiast, with a particular love for Small Form Factor (SFF) builds.  
- âš¡ Another fun fact: Iâ€™m also exploring psychology and neurobiology to understand myself beyond the realm of STEM.
