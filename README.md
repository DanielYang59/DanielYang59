### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I'm working on computational methods and tools for materials and beyond.
- ðŸŒ± I'm actively learning Computer Science.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've always been a hardware enthusiast, with a particular love for Small Form Factor (SFF) builds.  
- âš¡ Another fun fact: Iâ€™m interested in psychology and [neurobiology](https://www.hubermanlab.com/all-episodes) to understand ourselves beyond the realm of STEM.
